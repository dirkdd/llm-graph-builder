3. Verify memory usage
4. Test concurrent uploads

Expected Results:
✅ Large files upload successfully
✅ Progress updates smoothly
✅ No memory leaks observed
✅ Concurrent uploads handled properly
✅ Error handling for oversized files
```

#### **Test Case 9: Network Conditions**
```
Conditions: Slow 3G, intermittent connectivity
Steps:
1. Test uploads on slow connections
2. Simulate network interruptions
3. Verify retry mechanisms
4. Test timeout handling

Expected Results:
✅ Upload progress accurate on slow connections
✅ Network errors trigger retry logic
✅ Exponential backoff prevents spam
✅ Manual retry options available
✅ Graceful degradation to standard mode
```
