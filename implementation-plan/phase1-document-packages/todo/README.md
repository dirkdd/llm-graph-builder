# Phase 1 - Document Packages: Atomic Implementation Plan

## Overview
This directory contains the comprehensive, atomic implementation plan for Phase 1 - Document Packages. Each task is designed to be completable in 2-4 hours with clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.

## Implementation Strategy

### Iterative Backend-First Approach
1. **Phase 1.1**: Package Architecture (Week 1-1.5)
2. **Phase 1.2**: Hierarchical Chunking (Week 1.5-2)
3. **Phase 1.3**: Guidelines Navigation (Week 2-2.5)
4. **Phase 1.5**: Frontend Integration (Week 2.5-3)

### Task Organization
- **atomic-tasks.md**: Complete list of all 24 atomic tasks
- **backend-tasks.md**: Detailed backend implementation tasks (1-16)
- **frontend-tasks.md**: Detailed frontend implementation tasks (17-24)
- **file-structure.md**: Complete file structure to be created
- **acceptance-criteria.md**: Success criteria for each phase
- **timeline.md**: Detailed implementation timeline

## Key Innovations

### Document Package System
- Reusable document structures that can be saved and updated in place
- Package templates for mortgage categories (NQM, RTL, SBC, CONV)
- Version control and relationship management

### Hierarchical Document Processing
- Navigation-aware chunking that maintains document structure
- Complete decision tree extraction with mandatory ROOT → BRANCH → LEAF paths
- Context-preserving entity extraction

### Seamless Frontend Integration
- Package management interface maintaining existing UI patterns
- Enhanced upload flow with package selection
- Navigation structure visualization
- Package-aware processing status indicators

## Getting Started

1. **Review atomic-tasks.md** for complete task breakdown
2. **Check dependencies** in timeline.md before starting any task
3. **Follow file-structure.md** for consistent organization
4. **Validate completion** using acceptance-criteria.md

## Success Metrics

### Backend Performance
- Navigation extraction: >95% accuracy
- Decision tree completeness: 100% (mandatory)
- Entity extraction: >90% recall
- Processing time: <45 seconds per 100 pages

### Frontend Integration
- Zero breaking changes to existing workflows
- Package creation time: <30 seconds
- 95% compatibility with existing UI patterns
- TypeScript coverage: >95%

## Quality Assurance

Each task includes:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with existing systems
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation updates
- Code review requirements

## Risk Mitigation

- Maintain backward compatibility throughout implementation
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Rollback procedures for each major component
- Regular integration testing with existing workflows
- Performance monitoring during development
