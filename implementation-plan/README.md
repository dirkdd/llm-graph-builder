# GraphRAG Pipeline Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview
This directory contains the comprehensive implementation plan for enhancing the llm-graph-builder with advanced mortgage document processing capabilities, focusing on hierarchical guidelines processing, sophisticated matrix-guideline relationships, and complete frontend integration. The plan follows an iterative approach with backend development followed by frontend integration phases to enable testing and validation at each stage.

## Project Goals
1. **Document Package Management**: Create reusable document structures that can be saved and updated in place
2. **Hierarchical Guidelines Processing**: Extract and maintain chapter/section/subsection relationships
3. **Advanced Matrix Processing**: Multi-type classification with cross-document intelligence
4. **Integrated Knowledge Graph**: Connect guidelines navigation with matrix qualification criteria
5. **Production-Ready System**: Enterprise features including webhooks, exports, and quality assurance
6. **Comprehensive Frontend Integration**: Sophisticated user interfaces maintaining existing design patterns

## Key Innovations

### 1. Hierarchical Document Understanding
- Replace flat text chunking with navigation-aware processing
- Maintain document structure (chapters, sections, subsections)
- Enable navigation-based retrieval and reasoning

### 2. Bidirectional Guidelines-Matrix Integration
- Guidelines sections reference specific matrix cells
- Matrix cells link back to explanatory guidelines
- Automatic consistency validation between document types

### 3. Complete Decision Tree Extraction
- Every decision path has ROOT → BRANCH → LEAF nodes
- No orphaned decision nodes
- Full traceability from policy to outcome

### 4. Multi-Modal Retrieval System
- Navigation-based (follow document structure)
- Entity-based (find related concepts)
- Matrix-based (qualification checking)
- Decision-based (follow decision paths)

### 5. Iterative Frontend Integration
- Backend development followed by frontend integration phases
- Enables testing and validation at each stage
- Maintains existing UI patterns and design consistency
- Allows for iterative improvements and user feedback
