## Key Innovations

### 1. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED: Two-Structure Architecture with 4-Tier Hierarchy**

#### **Structure 1: Package Management (Templates/Expectations)**
```
DocumentPackage {package_id: "pkg_123"} 
    ├── -[:CONTAINS_CATEGORY]-> MortgageCategory {category_code: "NQM"}
    │       └── -[:CONTAINS]-> Product {product_id: "prod_123"}
    │               └── -[:CONTAINS]-> PackageDocument {document_type: "Guidelines"}
    │                       ↑
    │               Document {fileName: "file.pdf"} <-[:HAS_UPLOADED]
    └── -[:CONTAINS_CATEGORY]-> MortgageCategory {category_code: "QM"}
            └── -[:CONTAINS]-> Product {product_id: "prod_456"}
```

#### **Structure 2: Knowledge Extraction (Content/Results)**
```
DocumentPackage {package_id: "pkg_123", knowledge_extracted: true}
    ├── -[:CONTAINS_CATEGORY]-> MortgageCategory {category_code: "NQM", knowledge_extracted: true}
    │       └── -[:CONTAINS]-> Product {product_id: "prod_123", knowledge_extracted: true}
    │               └── -[:EXTRACTED_FROM_DOCUMENT]-> Document {fileName: "file.pdf"}
    │                       └── -[:PROCESSED_INTO]-> Guidelines {content: "extracted..."}
    └── -[:CONTAINS_CATEGORY]-> MortgageCategory {category_code: "QM", knowledge_extracted: true}
```
