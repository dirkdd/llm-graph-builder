# Task 12: Create Navigation Graph Builder - READY

## Overview
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Dependencies**: Tasks 9, 11  
**Phase**: 1.3 Guidelines Navigation

## Description
Build comprehensive navigation graphs that provide structured representation of document hierarchies. This task creates the NavigationGraphBuilder class that constructs complete navigation graphs from hierarchical chunks and navigation nodes.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Implementation
- [ ] NavigationGraphBuilder class with database integration
- [ ] build_navigation_graph method with complete pipeline
- [ ] enhance_navigation_nodes method for graph enhancement
- [ ] Navigation validation and completeness checking
- [ ] Integration with package configuration
- [ ] Performance optimization for large documents
- [ ] Tests with mortgage guideline samples

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `backend/src/navigation_graph.py`
- [ ] Implement GraphBuildResult and NavigationGraphMetrics data structures
- [ ] Full navigation graph building pipeline with 10+ core methods
- [ ] Navigation node and chunk creation with hierarchical relationships
- [ ] Comprehensive graph metrics calculation and validation
- [ ] Error handling, logging, and type safety throughout
- [ ] Complete test suite with mocking

### Data Models
- [ ] NavigationGraphBuilder class with Neo4j integration
- [ ] GraphBuildResult for tracking build outcomes
- [ ] NavigationGraphMetrics for quality assessment
- [ ] Navigation node enhancement capabilities
- [ ] Hierarchical relationship creation

### Quality Standards
- [ ] 100% acceptance criteria implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Performance optimization for large documents
- [ ] Type hints and validation throughout
- [ ] Integration with existing package system

## Files to Create
- `backend/src/navigation_graph.py` - Complete implementation
- `backend/tests/test_navigation_graph.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `backend/validate_task_12.py` - Validation script

## Success Metrics
- All acceptance criteria must pass validation
- Navigation graph builder creates complete hierarchical structures
- Integration with package configuration works seamlessly
- Performance meets standards for large mortgage documents
- Tests provide comprehensive coverage of functionality

## Integration Points
- Uses NavigationNode and HierarchicalChunk models from Task 9
- Integrates with enhanced processing pipeline from Task 11
- Provides foundation for decision tree extraction (Task 13)
- Enables guidelines entity extraction (Task 14)
