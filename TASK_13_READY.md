# Task 13: Implement Decision Tree Extractor - READY

## Overview
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Dependencies**: Task 12  
**Phase**: 1.3 Guidelines Navigation

## Description
Extract complete decision trees with mandatory outcomes from mortgage guideline documents. This task ensures ROOT → BRANCH → LEAF completeness with guaranteed outcomes (APPROVE, DECLINE, REFER) for all decision paths.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Implementation
- [ ] DecisionTreeExtractor class with complete extraction pipeline
- [ ] extract_complete_decision_trees method with 8-step process
- [ ] create_leaf_node method for mandatory outcomes
- [ ] Decision tree validation with 100% completeness checking
- [ ] APPROVE, DECLINE, REFER outcome guarantee
- [ ] Logical flow creation and validation
- [ ] Tests ensuring no orphaned decision nodes

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `backend/src/decision_tree_extractor.py`
- [ ] Implement DecisionTreeExtractionResult, DecisionPath, and DecisionTreeMetrics data structures
- [ ] ROOT → BRANCH → LEAF completeness guarantee with mandatory outcomes
- [ ] LLM-powered decision logic extraction with JSON parsing and regex fallback
- [ ] Mortgage-specific decision patterns (credit score, DTI, employment, etc.)
- [ ] Complete validation and metrics calculation system
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with mortgage scenarios

### Data Models
- [ ] DecisionTreeExtractor class with extraction pipeline
- [ ] DecisionTreeExtractionResult for tracking extraction outcomes
- [ ] DecisionPath for representing decision flows
- [ ] DecisionTreeMetrics for quality assessment
- [ ] Mandatory outcome creation system

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] 100% decision tree completeness validation
- [ ] All decision paths must lead to outcomes
- [ ] No orphaned decision nodes allowed
- [ ] Logical flow validation and consistency checking
- [ ] Quality metrics and scoring system

## Files to Create
- `backend/src/decision_tree_extractor.py` - Complete implementation
- `backend/tests/test_decision_tree_extractor.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `backend/validate_task_13.py` - Validation script

## Success Metrics
- All acceptance criteria must pass validation
- 100% decision tree completeness for all extracted trees
- Every decision path must have a guaranteed outcome
- No orphaned decision nodes in any extraction
- Performance meets standards for complex mortgage guidelines

## Integration Points
- Uses NavigationGraphBuilder from Task 12
- Integrates with hierarchical chunking from Phase 1.2
- Provides foundation for decision tree validation (Task 15)
- Enables complete mortgage decision logic extraction

## Decision Tree Requirements
- **ROOT nodes**: Entry points to decision processes
- **BRANCH nodes**: Decision points with conditions
- **LEAF nodes**: Mandatory outcomes (APPROVE, DECLINE, REFER)
- **Completeness**: Every path from ROOT to LEAF must be complete
- **Validation**: 100% coverage with no orphaned nodes
